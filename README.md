# AOI_Defect_Detection
This is the subject of one of the exercises on AIdea platform.
## Brief Introduction
Automated optical inspection (AOI) is a high speed and precise optical detection system, which utilizing the computer vision (CV) as a core of detection technique. This method has the better performance in optical detection rather than manual inspection using the optical instrument in the past. The application of AOI is worldwide. We can easily find its trace in several domains, such as R&D in high-tech industries , manufacturing quality control, as well as national defense...etc. Therefore, this project is to improve the efficacy of AOI through the data sicience.
